    <p>Canvas Student allows students to access their courses and groups using a mobile device.
      Students can submit assignments, participate in discussions, view grades and course materials.
      The app also provides access to course calendars, To Do items, notifications, and Conversations messages.
      Canvas is built to make teaching and learning easier for everyone. It is an easy-to-use,
      complete learning management system that supports teachers and students in teaching and learning.
      Canvas can ensure that both face-to-face and distance learning are digitally supported optimally.
      You can think of finding the digital learning material,
      collaborating with the teachers and fellow students remotely, handing in assignments,
      getting feedback from your teacher or using a quiz module to activate knowledge and test whether you have understood the explanation.</p>

  <h2>First look</h2>
  <section  class="canvas-1">
  <img src="img/canvas.png" alt="canvas" width="700" height="600">
  <p>The first thing you see when you enter Canvas is the DashBoard, where you can see all the subjects you get at
  school. If you look at the left you see there are different options, such as account, where you can change your
  profile information or your profile picture, the calendar, where you can see all the important dates, such as
  the day when you take a test, and also whenever you have a free day.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>Courses</h2>
  <section class="courses-1">
    <img src="img/courses.png" alt="courses">
    <p>This is the courses tab, where you can see all your subjects and all the things you will do for the rest
    of the year, being separated in periods. The following subjects are the ones I have for this year:
    Citizenship, where we talk about politics and anything related with the society. The english subject, where
    we learn to speak English, the Dutch subject, where we learn Dutch, the Math class, and the rest are
    IT related classes, like the communication class, which is really important, because communication is necessary
    when you are in a team or when you have to ask your employer what you need to do for his/her website.</p>
