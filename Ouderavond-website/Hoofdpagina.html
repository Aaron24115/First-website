    <h1>Parents evening</h1>
    <p class="ouderavond"> A Parents Evening is an evening where teachers discuss the progress of their students with parents.
        They also exchange ideas on various topics. In the parents' evening, the teachers and father and/or mother get to know
        each other. The teacher tells the parents how the child behaves in class and what the activity is like.
        When parents and teacher meet on such an evening, the pupil is usually not present, but in this case he is.</p>
