  <p>In certain circumstances you will need help to do something, maybe because of an illness or a psychological problem. This
    is also a problem for students, who may also have it hard to do some things because of said things.
  That's why there are some programs made for these circumstances, which are going to be named under this text.</p>

    <p>School social work is a way to help children who have it difficult at doing things at school.
    Many students are doing well at school. They conclude their school career with a diploma. But that path is not obvious to everyone.
    The school social workers advice and support to identify and tackle problems in students more quickly.
    Some students require extra support in or outside the classroom. Problems at home or at school can hinder school performance
    and participation.</p>

    When the teacher/mentor identifies concerns in a child's class, he/she informs the parents in the first instance. If necessary, the internal supervisor/care coordinator calls in the school social worker.
      During the health examination by the youth doctor/youth nurse, a referral can be made to the school social worker.
      The school social worker invites parents/carers to the school or makes a home visit. If during the interviews it
      appears that assistance is necessary/desired, the school social worker advises and/or guides the parents/carers in the
      referral.
